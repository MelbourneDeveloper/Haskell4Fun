# Haskell4.fun

A modern, interactive website for learning Haskell programming concepts. We are aiming to make Haskell accessible to everyone and add more labs so that people can directly try Haskell without needing to install anything.

## Local Development

To run the site locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Or use a local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

### Experimental Content

This website contains some inaccuracies. We encourage Haskell developers to contribute to this website by correcting mistakes and adding new content. This is a community effort to make Haskell more accessible to everyone. We steer clear of jargon and category theory as to avoid overwhelming the reader. Please submit pull requests [here](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Haskell4Fun) to modify the content. 

## Contributing

No need to clone the repo locally. All content is markdown so you can just edit in on GitHub and submit a PR.

Or,

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
